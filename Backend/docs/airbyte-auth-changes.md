# Airbyte Authentication and Workspace Optimizations

## Changes Made

### Authentication Flow
- Updated `getToken()` to properly validate environment variables
- Added error handling for missing credentials
- Improved token validation and error reporting

### Workspace Management
- Added direct use of `AIRBYTE_WORKSPACE_ID` from .env file
- Eliminated unnecessary API calls when workspace ID is already available
- Added fallback to API for workspace retrieval only when necessary

### API Request Authorization
- Enhanced `getAuthorizedHeaders()` to provide better error handling
- Removed empty header returns to fail early when authentication isn't possible

### General Improvements
- Added validation of required environment variables during service initialization
- Added more detailed logging for API operations
- Improved error handling with specific error messages
- Added request timeout configuration

## Testing
- Created a test file to verify authentication flow: `test-auth.js`

## Requirements
Ensure the following environment variables are set in your .env file:
- `AIRBYTE_URL`: URL of your Airbyte API
- `AIRBYTE_CLIENT_ID`: Client ID for authentication
- `AIRBYTE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Client secret for authentication
- `AIRBYTE_WORKSPACE_ID`: ID of the single workspace being used

## Next Steps
1. Run the test file to verify authentication works properly:
   ```bash
   node test-auth.js
   ```

2. Update other API calls in the service to use the optimized authentication methods
