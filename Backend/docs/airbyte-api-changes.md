# Airbyte Integration Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Fixed

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Updated token retrieval mechanism to use client ID and secret from environment variables
   - Added proper token caching and error handling

2. **Workspace ID Management**
   - Simplified to always use the AIRBYTE_WORKSPACE_ID from environment variables
   - Removed unnecessary API calls for workspace retrieval

3. **Source Definitions Access**
   - Added local source definitions generation to avoid 403 Forbidden errors
   - The system now generates source definitions from the local configuration
   - This ensures the application continues to function while API permission issues are resolved

4. **Source Details Retrieval**
   - Added a new `getAirbyteSource` method that uses the correct endpoint (`GET /sources/{sourceId}`)
   - Enhanced `getSourceDetails` to combine local database information with Airbyte API data when available
   - Added graceful fallback to local data when Airbyte API access fails

## API Endpoint Changes

The correct Airbyte API endpoints for source operations are:

1. **Get Source Details**
   - `GET /sources/{sourceId}`
   - Used when a user clicks on an existing source to view details

2. **List Source Definitions**
   - `GET /workspaces/{workspaceId}/definitions/sources`
   - Used to retrieve all available source types

## Current Implementation

The current implementation uses static source definitions derived from your local configurations in `sourceConfigs.js`. This ensures that your application can continue functioning even if there are API permission issues. When API access is restored, you can update the commented code in the `listSourceDefinitions` method to use the proper API endpoint.

## Testing

The solution has been tested and verified with:
- Authentication token retrieval ✓
- Workspace ID resolution ✓
- Source definitions generation ✓

## Next Steps

1. Resolve any API permission issues with the Airbyte server
2. Once API permissions are resolved, consider uncommenting the API-based source definitions retrieval code
3. Update other API endpoints (connections, schemas, etc.) to use the correct paths
4. Add further error handling and logging to diagnose any future API issues
